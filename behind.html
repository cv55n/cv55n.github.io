        <h1>
            i think about it all the time
        </h1>

        <p>
            this idea first came to me during a time where i was overwhelmed by my thoughts and started visualizing each one as an open tab. that shift in perspective helped me calm down and better manage myself. i also started to feel the mental heat and sluggishness, as if my brain is functioning like an overworked computer. after this moment i kept having recurring thoughts and started to imagine my mind in a computer context such as having opened thought tabs running in the background, memories surfacing at unwarranted times, elements of my inner world being organized into folders, and so on. 
        </p>

        <p>
            the human body and mind are so complex, yet beautiful. i felt compelled to dissect the mind by mapping it out using my macbook and tools available in ios. what started as a thought eventually turned into a passion project i've been working on since december 2024. the mind being exhibited does not belong to a real person, but it is influenced partly by my personal experiences. i chose not to model it after myself, as doing so felt too invasive to share publicly. instead, creating a fictional persona gave me the freedom to build a character with their own stories and inner turmoil, offering the audience a deeper look into this imagined mind. the process of making this was both healing and painful. i had to look inward and sit with vulnerable moments by really understanding and asking myself difficult questions to extract raw thoughts, emotions, experiences, and memories. i then translated those findings into my interpretation of what the brain would look like if it were modeled after a computer.
        </p>

        <p>
            in this project, i focused on five categories: home screen, current, memories, you, and dreams.
        </p>

        <p>
            the <b>home screen</b> is what i imagine the main starting screen to look like in someone's mind. you are welcomed with the main folders or the main characteristics that make up a person. 
        </p>

        <p>
            — within the folders there’s even more subfolders that go more in depth and it’s much more complex
        </p>

        <p>
            the second screen displays a still image representing the <b>current</b> state of the person’s mind. we can see all the thoughts the character has had since waking up, along with some memories they’re reflecting on in the moment. a video recording accompanies the image, putting all of this into perspective by showing it happening in real time.
        </p>

        <p>
            the <b>memories</b> folder holds all the memories but we can only see a portion. each memory has a key frame accompanied by a brief description. the folder also comes with its own system that helps better sort and organize memories more effectively. 
        </p>

        <p>
            the <b>you</b> screen shows when the character thinks of this person and in doing so she thinks of him as a whole. 
        </p>

        <p>
            the <b>dream</b> folder shows a small collection of recent dreams overlapping with old dreams. this is supposed to represent the fuzziness and blur memory you get when trying to recap a dream. you only remember parts of it and it all seems like a faint memory . in some cases it feels near impossible trying to recreate it in your head so you’re left with just fragments of still images. 
        </p>

        <p>
            there are some folders and parts of the brain i wished to have delved into and highlighted in this project but due to software limitation i was not able to do so. i hope in the near future i end up doing a second part that goes more in depth and is more detailed, but for now i'm happy with what i have created and excited i get to share this to the world. 
        </p>

        <p>
            all images and videos were outsourced and curated by me. <br> thank you.
